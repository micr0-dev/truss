                       OVERWORKED LICENSE
    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

0. DEFINITIONS

   For clarity's sake, because lawyers ruin everything:

   "This License" refers to version 2 of the Overworked License.

   "The Program" means any copyrightable work licensed under this License.

   "You" means an individual or entity exercising permissions granted by
   this License.

   "Source Code" means the preferred form of the work for making
   modifications to it, including all modules it contains, plus any
   associated interface definition files, scripts used to control
   compilation and installation of the executable, or source code
   differential comparisons against either the original source code
   or another well-known, available source code.

   "Object Code" means any non-source form of a work, including but not
   limited to compiled object code, generated documentation, and conversions
   to other media types.

   "Modify" means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in a fashion
   requiring copyright permission, other than making an exact copy. The
   resulting work is called a "modified version" of the earlier work or a
   work "based on" the earlier work.

   "Propagate" means to do anything with the work that, without permission,
   would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under
   applicable copyright law, except executing it on a computer or modifying
   a private copy.

   "Convey" means any kind of propagation that enables other parties to make
   or receive copies, like sharing it on GitHub or some shit.

   "Evil" includes but is not limited to: causing harm to individuals,
   violating human rights, creating surveillance systems to oppress people,
   supporting authoritarian regimes, assisting in the development of weapons
   designed to target civilians, creating technology that disproportionately
   harms marginalized communities, developing addictive algorithms designed
   to exploit psychological vulnerabilities, implementing systems that deprive
   people of basic resources, or being a general douchebag about how you use
   this software. If you have to ask yourself "is this evil?" then it probably is.

1. BASIC PERMISSIONS

   You can do whatever the fuck you want with this software: use, copy,
   modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies,
   subject to the other terms of this License. No need to ask permission.
   I'm too tired to say no anyway.

   This License explicitly affirms your unlimited permission to run the
   unmodified Program. The output from running a covered work is covered
   by this License only if the output, given its content, constitutes a
   covered work. This License acknowledges your rights of fair use or
   other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.

2. COPYLEFT PROVISION

   All modified versions of the Program must be distributed under the terms
   of this same License. No exceptions. Don't try to weasel your way out of
   it by calling it something else or hiding it inside another license. This
   is a straight-up viral license, deal with it.

   When you modify the Program, your modified version must prominently offer
   all users, including those interacting with it remotely through a computer
   network, an opportunity to receive the Source Code of your version by
   providing access at no charge to the corresponding Source Code.

3. SOURCE CODE PROVISION

   When distributing copies of the Program, you must make the Source Code
   available under the terms of this License. For Object Code, you must do
   at least ONE of the following:

   a) Include the complete corresponding Source Code with the Object Code.

   b) Include a written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for
   as long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product
   model, to provide the Source Code to anyone who possesses the Object Code.

   c) Provide access to copy the Source Code from a network server at no
   charge. You must ensure the Source Code remains available for as long as
   needed to satisfy these requirements.

   d) If you received the Object Code with an offer to provide the Source Code,
   you may pass along the same offer.

   Yes, this is a pain in the ass, but that's the point. Source Code availability
   is not optional. The whole point is that people can see and modify the code.

   If you distribute Object Code in a physical product like hardware, you must
   include the Source Code on a durable physical medium, or provide a written
   offer to provide the Source Code. The Source Code must include installation
   information needed to install and run modified versions of the covered work
   in that physical product. What good is source code if you can't actually use it?

4. ATTRIBUTION

   The original author's name must be left intact in all copies or substantial
   portions of the software. Because, ya know, respect and shit. Don't pretend
   you wrote this. I suffered enough making it, at least let me have the credit.

   This requirement cannot be removed or altered in any derivative works. You
   can add your own attribution for your modifications, but you can't remove mine.

5. PATENT LICENSE

   Each contributor automatically grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide,
   royalty-free patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims
   to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import, and otherwise run, modify, and
   propagate the Program.

   "Essential patent claims" are all patent claims owned or controlled by the
   contributor, whether already acquired or hereafter acquired, that would be
   infringed by some manner, permitted by this License, of making, using, or
   selling the Program, but do not include claims that would be infringed only
   as a consequence of further modification of the Program.

   If you sue anyone over patent issues related to this software, including
   filing a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit, your rights under this
   License terminate automatically. Patent litigation is for corporate assholes.

   If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license, and
   the Source Code is not freely available for everyone to copy under the
   terms of this License, then you must either (1) make the Source Code
   available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the patent
   license for this particular work, or (3) arrange to extend the patent
   license to downstream recipients in a manner consistent with this License.

6. NO EVIL CLAUSE

   Don't use the software for evil. You know what evil is. Don't pretend you
   don't. If you're using this in a dystopian megacorp or some sketchy-ass
   government project, just stop. This isn't about politicsâ€”it's about basic
   human decency.

   In cases of dispute over what constitutes "evil," the original author
   reserves the right to make determinations based on their reasonable
   judgment, taking into account human rights principles, potential harm to
   individuals or communities, and general ethical standards that a reasonable
   person would recognize.

   If your use of the software is later determined to fall within the "evil"
   category, you must cease using the software immediately upon notice. The
   original author's determination of "evil" is final for purposes of your
   license rights, though you may of course challenge such determination in
   a court of competent jurisdiction if you really want to make that argument.

7. TERMINATION

   If you violate any term of this License, your rights under it terminate
   automatically. However, if you stop being a dumbass and fix your violation
   within 30 days after discovering it, your rights will be reinstated permanently.

   If you've never received notice of a violation of this License for a
   particular work, and you subsequently receive such a notice, your rights
   will be reinstated permanently if you fix the violation within 30 days.

   Repeated violations followed by temporary fixes are not acceptable. If
   you've had your rights terminated and reinstated more than twice in a
   12-month period, you won't be eligible for automatic reinstatement for
   12 months after your most recent reinstatement.

   Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
   licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
   this License. Their rights remain in effect as long as they remain in
   full compliance.

8. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY

   There's absolutely no warranty of any kind. The software is provided
   "AS IS" without any promise it'll work, be fit for a particular purpose,
   or anything else. If it breaks, you fix it. Tough luck, bitch. This is
   software made by an overworked developer, not a product made by a Fortune
   500 company with a QA department.

   THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER
   EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES
   OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK
   AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE
   PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
   REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

   Seriously, there's no warranty. Like, at all. Zero. Zilch. Nada. If your
   server explodes because of my code, that's on you.

9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

   In no event, unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing,
   shall the original author or any contributor be liable for damages,
   including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential
   damages arising out of the use or inability to use the program.

   This includes, but is not limited to: loss of data, data being rendered
   inaccurate, losses sustained by you or third parties, a failure of the
   program to operate with any other programs, procurement of substitute
   goods or services, business interruption, loss of profits, or any other
   commercial damages.

   Yeah, I'm not paying for your shit if this software somehow ruins your day.
   I'm probably broke anyway.

   IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL
   ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS THE
   PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
   GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE
   USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM, EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY
   HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

10. INTERPRETATION

    If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable or invalid,
    that provision will be enforced to the maximum extent possible, and the
    other provisions will remain in full effect. I tried my best to make this
    legit, but I'm not a lawyer.

    If conditions are imposed on you that contradict the conditions of this
    License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If
    you cannot convey a covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your
    obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then
    as a consequence you may not convey it at all.

11. COMPATIBILITY WITH OTHER LICENSES

    If you combine work licensed under this License with work licensed under
    other licenses, you must ensure that the combined work as a whole can be
    distributed under terms that preserve the obligations of this License
    for the parts originally licensed under this License. This is particularly
    important for the NO EVIL CLAUSE, which must be preserved.

    Work licensed under compatible copyleft licenses (such as GPL v3) may be
    combined with work under this License, provided the combined work is
    licensed under both licenses simultaneously, without weakening the
    provisions of either license.

12. FUTURE VERSIONS

    The author may publish revised and/or new versions of the Overworked
    License. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number.
    You may apply the terms of any version of this License published by
    the author to your Program.

    If the Program does not specify a version number of this License, you
    may choose any version ever published by the author. Later license
    versions may give you additional or different permissions, but will not
    impose additional obligations on any copyright holder who has released
    materials under previous versions.
