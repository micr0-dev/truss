# Truss

Truss is a bridge between the Fediverse and Bluesky - connecting different social platforms while respecting their unique characteristics.

Named after the architectural element that distributes weight and tension across structures, Truss aims to strengthen connections between online communities without adding unnecessary complexity.

Built with simplicity and resilience in mind, Truss embodies the philosophy that digital spaces should remain interconnected despite their differences. It preserves the essence of conversations across platforms while maintaining their integrity.

In a fragmented social media landscape, Truss represents a small step toward a more unified digital commons where ideas can flow freely between separate but complementary spaces.
